Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I managed to make a mod that swaps textures in game and displays credits to me.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I need to make it be able to toggle between different textures.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I can edit textures, but when I do it messes up the lighting.
